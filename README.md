## Description

This is a base website for the future projects that I will create throughout the bootcamp.
This will in the end be a place for future employers and clients to view my previous works.

## Usage

The website is designed to be interactive when images and links are selected. 
If you click on the nav bar should change the website view to the specific topic selected.
